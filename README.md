# Coimbra China notes by Joaquim Carvalho

These are my notes on the historical connections between Coimbra (Portugal) and China, mostly through the activities of the Jesuit missionaries based in Coimbra during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

The role of Coimbra in the Jesuit missionary entreprise is not fully recognized in the literature. Here I focus of the China missions, but Coimbra was also a key location for the Jesuit missions to India, Japan and Brazil.
