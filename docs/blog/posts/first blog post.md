# "Release early, release often"

This is the famous [software development philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) promoted by [Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond).

As I struggle with the huge amount of information related the Jesuit mission in China, I find myself trapped in the paralysis of never being ready to write. 

So I am borrowing this from the [Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) in the hope of breaking the writer's paralysis.

The aim is to write quickly short synthesis, and iterate and improve frequently.
