Matteo Ricci was in Coimbra from June 1577 until his departure to India in March 1578.

This stay of a few months at the jesuit College in Coimbra was common.

Recruits for the Indian missions would travel to Portugal to board  the fleet that every year departed from Lisbon to Goa around March-Abril. If they arrived too late to depart that year they would have to wait for the next departure.

Coimbra was a natural place to spend the waiting time. The jesuit college was created in 1543, specifically to train the missionaries for the Eastern missions. It would fulfil its mission by being the top recruitment location for the missionaries destined to China.

Many other relevant jesuit missionaries did their layover at Coimbra, namely Ferdinand Verbiest and Giuseppe Castiglioni.
